Since the start of the operation, we have successfully diverted nearly 15 thousand pounds of organics from going to the landfill. This was accomplished in very little time, minimal overhead, a small amount of space, and relatively small labor investments.</p><p>To put this in perspective:<br>Each week on Tuesdays, food that is not fit for human consumption is set aside by food bank volunteers in 17 gallon totes. The following day the inedible food is composted by N4N and Desert Compost volunteers at the onsite composting area. The space is about 9 by 30 ft.  It takes 2-3 people approx 1 hour per week to process up to 1K lbs of food scraps.The impact of this work speaks for itself- Since November 2021 the N4N site has diverted 15 thousand pounds of organics from the landfill. The greenhouse gas diversion metrics are equivalent to:</p><p><ul><li>9000 miles driven</li><li>404 gallons of gas</li><li>436 cell phone charges</li><li>4 acres of US forest</li></ul></p><p>Along with the environmental savings, the N4N program achieved fiscal savings by cutting the cost of the large dumpster and waste services they were previously relying on from the garbage company. These savings were put into restoring their community food access garden which they built from soil made by community compost, thereby creating a closed loop food system.</p>",

    'project_text': '<p>The McCarthy Family and Child Development Center at College of the Desert (MCFCDC) and Desert Compost (DC), began collaborating in March 2022.</p><p>Desert Compost designed a community composting program for MCFCDC to reduce the landfill -bound organic waste generated from the daily food preparation activities in the MCFCDC kitchen and student meal times, as well as to process community organics donated by MCFCDC families. Material from these inputs will be transformed into healthy soil, which can be used to grow food on campus in the community garden, ¼ acre chef’s kitchen access garden, and campus agricultural operations such as vineyards, orchards, and greenhouse. The composting program will model a closed loop food system at the campus.</p><p>This project serves as a model for future composting and zero waste program implementation on other areas of the campus and will not only model climate adaptability and appropriateness of sustainability measures in harsh climates, but the project will serve as a unique research opportunity. Desert Compost will be collecting data as part of the Community Composting for Green Spaces Grant program that can inform other projects across the state and beyond that may be dealing with extreme heat, wind, arid climates, poor soil quality, and elevated u.v. indexes-the very nature of composting in the desert. MCFCDC and DC’s community/university partnership will highlight innovation for composting, food cultivation, and healthy food systems in the desert.</p>',
